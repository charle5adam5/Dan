    Dave and Momma Jill are the local heroes of the
    Saint Augustine, Fl Music scene. They have been
    hosting live music at their resident bar Shanghai
    Nobby's for over 30 years! We get into the back story
    of how Nobby's gained its roots and how Dave And Jill
    sowed their wild oats together! This is a heart felt
    episode full of life lessons, funny stories of the
    past, and a positive outlook to the future of music.
    Thank you Dave and Jill for carrying the torch. Much
    love.
